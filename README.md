# WorldPainter Script for Advanced Filter Options

This script extends the functionality of the WorldPainter API by enabling more flexible global operations. The standard WorldPainter API lacks the capability to combine multiple filters, such as "only on Sand" and "only on Water." This script addresses that limitation by allowing more complex and customizable operations for tedious global tasks.

The first section of the script defines the objects and methods required to perform these enhanced operations. Following that, several examples are provided to demonstrate usage. The syntax is designed to be as close to the original WorldPainter API as possible, ensuring ease of adoption for users familiar with the standard API.
